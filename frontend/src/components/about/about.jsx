                  I came up with the idea of PoliSee to build a
                    platform that could help people tap into their power to influence their government.
                    As a software engineer I have a passion for making platforms
                    that allow people to better digest information, or get their
                    voice into the world

                  <p>
                    {" "}
                    On a less serious note I'm a big fan of Video Games, Spaghetti Westerns, and Camping. 
                    While politics and law are certianly interests of mine, I really am interested in using sofware engineering to give form to interesting ideas!

                  I'm passionate about history and politics, and fascinated by
                  the longlasting effects they can have on our society. Our hope
                  with Polisee was to streamline the process of getting in touch
                  with your representatives, because getting your voice heard is
                  now more important than ever.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I primarily worked on integrating the various APIs into our
                  application and handling the responses to maximize efficiency
                  and usability. I hope you found the information gathered by
                  Polisee useful and feel empowered to get involved. Please feel
                  free to reach out and get in touch about any opportunities you
                  might have, and don't forget to vote.

              Hi! Besides coding (and building custom SVGs!) Iâ€™m passionate about tons of things! Not the least of which being Disney movies and Dungeons and Dragons!
I love programming because it gives me the ability to build up functional (and mostly) fancy things to play with and watch! 
                </p>
                <p>
                I acted as both a graphic designer and a front facing lead for all of the styling here on the site! My job was not only to come up with the layout for the site, but to make
sure the information we were pulling in was organized in an easy to read and generally pleasing way. At the time of writing this I've actually started working as an instructor for App Academy, but please feel free to reach out with any opportunities!
